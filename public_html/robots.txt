# wowrack dot com says that ezooms.com IP belongs to one of their clients; dotnetdotcom.org and that their main purpose for this machine is to crawl/index the content just like google bot.
# The spider from ezooms.com visits robots.txt frequently but ignore the rules written in robots.txt.
# Therefore the only way to stop this secret spider is to block the IP-range.
# One of the theories is that the spider belongs to http://www.seomoz.org/ (anagram for ezooms) who tries to hide their bot in this way.
# The email they give out is fake, just as their web site obviously is !!!
# Ezooms is a parasite and they are definitely up to no good !!!
